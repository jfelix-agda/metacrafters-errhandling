# Metacrafters Solidity Project

This is a project for the assessment portion of the Metacrafters course *Functions and Errors - ETH + AVAX*

## Description
The project was created to demonstrate basic error handling using `assert`, `require`, and `revert`.

## Getting Started
### Executing program
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.23" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile solidity-token.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "sampleToken" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.
